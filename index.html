        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The debate over the Fighter of the Year for 2024 has sparked discussions among MMA
            fans and experts alike. Two names stand out: Ilia Topuria and Alex Pereira. Both have had
            stellar years, but when analyzing their achievements in-depth, it becomes clear that Topuria’s
            accomplishments overshadow Pereira’s in terms of quality.</p>

        <p>While Pereira’s activity is commendable, his opponents—aside from Jiří
            Procházka—do not match the legendary status of Volkanovski and Holloway. Topuria’s wins are
            not just victories; they are monumental achievements against two of the greatest featherweights
            of all time.</p>

    <section id="pantoja">
        <h2>Why Not Alexandre Pantoja?</h2>
        <p>Alexandre Pantoja is another name that deserves recognition. With three successful
            title defenses in the Flyweight division, he has proven himself to be a dominant champion.
            However, the Flyweight division remains one of the most underrated in the UFC, and this often
            impacts the visibility of its champions.</p>
        <p>Pantoja’s achievements are incredible, but the lack of marquee opponents or
            high-profile events compared to Topuria and Pereira places him just below them in the Fighter of
            the Year discussion.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="faq">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <p><strong>Why does Ilia Topuria deserve Fighter of the Year?</strong></p>
        <p>Topuria's victories over Alexander Volkanovski and Max Holloway stand out due to the
            caliber of his opponents, both of whom are considered legends in the featherweight division. His
            accomplishments define quality over quantity.</p>
        <p><strong>What makes Alex Pereira a strong contender?</strong></p>
        <p>Pereira’s success in winning and defending the Light Heavyweight title on short notice,
            along with his activity level, makes him a compelling candidate. However, the quality of his
            opponents does not rival Topuria's.</p>
        <p><strong>Why isn’t Alexandre Pantoja more recognized?</strong></p>
        <p>Despite defending the Flyweight title three times, Pantoja competes in a division that
            often gets overlooked. While his achievements are remarkable, they lack the same visibility as
            those of Topuria and Pereira.</p>
        <p><strong>What criteria determine Fighter of the Year?</strong></p>
        <p>Typically, factors like quality of opponents, number of victories, title wins and defenses,
            and overall impact on the sport are considered. Topuria excels in these metrics, particularly in
            the quality of his opposition.</p>
        <p><strong>Can Pereira still win the award?</strong></p>
        <p>Absolutely. If activity and the number of fights defended weigh more heavily for some
            analysts, Pereira could take the honor. However, Topuria's victories resonate more in terms of
            legacy and impact.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion: The Case for Ilia Topuria</h2>
        <p>Ilia Topuria’s 2024 campaign stands out not just for its quality but for the magnitude of
            his victories. Beating Alexander Volkanovski, widely regarded as one of the greatest
            featherweights of all time, and defending against Max Holloway, a living legend, is an
            unparalleled feat.</p>
        <p>Alex Pereira undoubtedly had a remarkable year, stepping in on short notice and
            defending his title three times. However, the level of competition he faced does not compare to
            the legendary status of Topuria’s opponents.</p>
        <p>As fans, we recognize Pereira’s contributions, but as professionals analyzing the
            impact, it is clear that 2024 belongs to Ilia Topuria.</p>
